## Weekly Agenda

This week I tried fixing ported LPython tests in LFortran's
string refactor PR and C-interop tests in LPython. My
college semester started this week so I couldn't finish 
either of those.

## Achievements

- Began work on fixing more complicated bugs in post sync LP

## Goals for next week

The goal for next week is to finish the bugs I started working on 
and adding some more tests in LF.
