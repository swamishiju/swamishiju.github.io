{"content": "\n## Weekly Agenda\n\nThis week I worked on implementing good syntax for dicts \nand tuples, and porting more tests from LPython. The parser \nchanges however did reveal a shift/reduce conflict which we \nhad missed.\n\nWe also have a close to complete port of Lists and several fully ported tests.\n\n## Achievements\n\n- Fully ported several tests from LPython for lists\n- Implemented proper syntax for dicts, tuples\n\n## Code Samples\n\nAfter this week code like below now runs on LFortran using\nLFortran specific intrinsics which can compile into llvm\nand wasm. \n\n```f90\nprogram lp_test\n\n    integer :: x\n    \n    type(_lfortran_list(integer)) :: test_list = _lfortran_list_constant(1, 1, 1, 2)\n    test_list = _lfortran_concat(test_list, _lfortran_list_constant(1, 1, 1, 2))\n\n    call _lfortran_list_insert(test_list, 2, 3)\n    call _lfortran_list_clear(test_list)\n\n    type(_lfortran_dict(integer, integer(4))):: dict_i\n    dict_i = _lfortran_dict_constant(1, 2, 2, 5, 3, 7)\n\n    x = _lfortran_get_item(dict_i, 2)\n    call _lfortran_set_item(dict_i, 3, 5)\n\n    type(_lfortran_tuple(integer, real, character(len=:), logical)) :: t1\n    t1 = _lfortran_tuple_constant(1, 2.0, \"3\", .true.)\n    x = _lfortran_get_item(t3, 0)\nend program\n```\n\n## Pull Requests\n\n- [#7643 List intrinsics/tests - 1](https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/pull/7653)\n- [#7660 List intrinsics/tests - 2](https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/pull/7660)\n- [#7671 List intrinsics/tests - 3](https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/pull/7671)\n- [#7684 Parser changes and Tuple,Dict type](https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/pull/7684)\n- [#7698 Parser Shift/Reduce conflict resolution](https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/pull/7698)\n\n## Goals for next week\n\nThere has been some refactoring in the backend regarding \nhow types are treated so next week I plan on transitioning\nthe LPython specific backend code from relying on type_code\nto some other way of specifying type.\n\nAnother thing is to port remaining tests for the types\nincluding things like list of tuples and such.\n"}
