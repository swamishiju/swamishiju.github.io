{"content": "\n## Weekly Agenda\n\nThe string changes were still happening so a lot work wasn't\ndone on the LPython frontend, I continued exposing the data\ntypes to the frontend.\n\nA major target for this week was implementing better syntax\nand removing the specific hard coded types like\n_lfortran_list_integer to better more extensible syntax \nlike _lfortran_list(integer).\n\nA major roadblock I faced this week was making the dict \nsyntax proper. The changes I made to the parser for list, \nset were relatively minor which I could implement with minimal \nknowledge in Yacc. The dict syntax and tuple which I intend \nto implement next week is much harder to implement and requires\nI think bigger changes to the grammar.\n\n## Achievements\n\n- Implemented better syntax for the new declarations\n- Implemented declaration for all supported types\n- Implemented more intrinsics for lists\n- Implemented specific dict type\n\n## Code Samples\n\nAfter this week code like below now runs on LFortran using\nLFortran specific intrinsics which can compile into llvm and\nwasm. As an almost immediate benifit of the workflow changes \nnested list could be simply used without any changes to frontend \nor backend.\n\n```f90\nprogram lp_list\n\n    integer :: x\n    \n    type(_lfortran_list(integer)) :: test_list \n    type(_lfortran_list(real)) :: test_list_1\n    type(_lfortran_list(real(4))) :: test_list_2\n\n    call _lfortran_list_reverse(test_list)\n    x = _lfortran_list_count(test_list, 4)\n\n    type(_lfortran_set(integer)) :: test_set \n    \n    !
