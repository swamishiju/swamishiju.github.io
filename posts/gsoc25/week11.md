## Weekly Agenda

This week I continued working on the LP sync. Some 
tests fail on remote but not local so I'm trying to fix that.

I'm also trying to fix the regression of tuple and dict tests in LF.

## Achievements

- Locally have 183 tests in LP passing

## Pull Requests

- [#8301 Sync](https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/pull/8301)
- [#8359 Fix for dict regression](https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/pull/8359)

## Goals for next week

Continue the LPython sync and refactor Enum 
in similar way as union and struct
