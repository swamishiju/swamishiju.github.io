{"content": "\n## Weekly Agenda\n\nThis week I focused more on uncommenting tests in LPython.\nI've made good progress for unsigned integer types but \nC-interop still remains to be fixed.\n\nThe C-interop has some overlap with the string\nrefactor the extent of which I am not sure, but hopefully\nit shouldn't be a huge blocker.\n\n## Achievements\n\n- Fixed Unsigned integer properly in libasr\n- Made progress towards having C-introp working in LP\n\n## Pull Requests\n\n- [#8002 LP type - argument handling in C backend](https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/pull/8002)\n- [#8011 C backend dict-copy fix](https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/pull/8011)\n- [#8034 Support unsigned integer in LF](https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/pull/8034)\n- [#8037 Proper handling of string argument in C backend](https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/pull/8037)\n- [#8055 Unsigned int print fix](https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/pull/8055)\n- [#2862 Fixed unsigned integer tests](https://github.com/lcompilers/lpython/pull/2862)\n- [#2863 String arguments fix](https://github.com/lcompilers/lpython/pull/2863)\n\n## Goals for next week\n\nThe goal for next week is to get robust tests working\nfor the C-interop and unsigned integer PRs.\n\nThe string refactor will also most likely be finished\nsoon and likely break the LP type tests implemented \nin LF, so i need to work on fixing those too. When \nthat is done the libasr sync should go smoothly.\n"}
