{"content": "\n## Weekly Agenda\n\nThis was mostly spent refactoring the backend code and \nimproving the test coverage for the new types.\n\n## Achievements\n\n- Fully ported several tests from LPython for dicts\n- Fully ported all tests from LPython for tuples\n- Simplified syntax for dicts, tuples\n- Refactored back-end code\n\n## Code Samples\n\nThis week's work didn't introduce a ton of new syntax \nchanges other than taking the new types out of the type intrinsic.\n\n```f90\nprogram lp_test\n\n    _lfortran_list(integer)                                 :: test_list \n    _lfortran_dict(integer, real)                           :: test_dict\n    _lfortran_set(integer)                                  :: test_set\n    _lfortran_tuple(integer, _lfortran_tuple(integer))      :: test_tuple\n\nend program\n```\n\n## Pull Requests\n\n- [#7763 Implemented tests for new syntax](https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/pull/7763)\n- [#7799 Refactored function names](https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/pull/7799)\n- [#7807 Ported tuple tests](https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/pull/7807)\n- [#7813 Ported dict tests](https://github.com/lfortran/lfortran/pull/7813)\n\n## Goals for next week\n\nA main goal for next week is implementing Union types\ninto LFortran frontend so that we can extensively test \nit. This would go hand in hand with the introduction \non python types and help us make sync significantly easier.\n"}
